## #1 A brief introduction to JupyterLab

In this video, we take a brief tour of JupyterLab, an interactive computing environment used in this course.

#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UwAsLtl8nQ&t=0) |  Hi! In this video I will take

you on a brief tour of JupyterLab, which is an interactive computing environment that we use in this course. So when you start JupyterLab, you will eventually arrive at this view which is the main view to the interactive computing environment. This main view has two parts. On the left hand side you can see a file browser which allows you to browse the files and folders in the file system of the computer or server. On the right hand side you have a launcher which allows you to launch Jupyter Notebooks, consoles

applications for taking notes. On the far left hand side you see a toolbar which has several shortcuts. The first one on the top takes you to the file browser, whereas the second one shows all the running notebooks consoles and terminal sessions. The third one is especially important if you need accessibility features, so if you scroll down in this section which is called commands then you will find an option to

for the terminal and also for the JupyterLab interface. So let's explore the environment a bit. We can go back to the file browser here on top, and as you can see I already have a folder named notebooks on my server and I can click this folder to access it, and as you can see the folder has three subfolders. I can click part one,

some introductory materials on Python, and just by clicking this file here twice it will open up the Jupyter Notebook on the right hand side next to the launcher. You might also want to upload your own files to JupyterLab which is easily done by pressing this button right here, so you can click it and then choose files from your own computer

Finally, if you want to manipulate some files on the server via JupyterLab, you can always right click a file to open several options. You can copy, cut, download and even get shareable links to the files, which might be useful if you want to share or download your work. So this concludes the very brief overview of JupyterLab as an environment.

doing things in this environment so feel free to explore it on your own. I hope you found this video useful if you have any questions please leave a comment below; thanks and see you next time.
