## #27 How to make the most of the learning materials

In this short video, I give you a few tips for working with these materials, especially if you're only beginning to learn about Python and language technology. I will show how to use the YouTube videos in Picture-in-Picture mode while working in a Jupyter Notebook, and how to reset a Jupyter Notebook and continue where you left off.





✨ Check out the learning materials on Read the Docs: https://applied-language-technology.readthedocs.io



✨ Clone the repository with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive computing from GitHub: https://github.com/Applied-Language-Technology/notebooks



✨ Check out other videos in the Getting Started playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6cQi6qFlek2G1okRUjmFtiP_0e6MHJFN

talk about how to make the most of these learning materials, especially if you're just beginning to learn about Python and language technology. I want to start by talking about the way YouTube videos are incorporated into these Jupyter Notebooks, so if you take a look at this cell right here, we use a component of the Jupyter Notebook to load a video from YouTube and place it into this notebook. So if I run this cell it will load the video from YouTube. The picture-in-picture mode detaches the video

you can watch the video while also navigating the Jupyter Notebook. This means that you can scroll wherever you want in the Notebook while the video plays in the pop-up window. Next I want to talk about some ways of using the Jupyter Notebooks when you're writing and debugging code you quite often end up in a situation

for all cells in the Notebook. The best way to do this if you already have made quite a lot of progress in the Notebook is to choose the "Kernel" menu and the option "Restart and run up to the selected cell". This will restart the Notebook and run all the cells above the current cell. In this way you

preceding cells but you can simply continue where you left off. I hope you found this video useful, and if you have any questions or additional tips or tricks for working with these materials or with Jupyter Notebooks, just leave a comment below. Thanks!
